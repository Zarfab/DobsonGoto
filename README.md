# DobsonGoto
Adding track/goto functionality to a [Skywatcher Heritage P130](http://www.skywatcher.com/product/heritage-p130/) Dobsonian telescope

## Software
After struggling trying to create the program myself, 
I found the wonderful work of [Howard Dutton](https://github.com/hjd1964) 
and others, [OnStep](https://github.com/hjd1964/OnStep). 
Given all the ressources they provide, no need for me to explain how it works. 
I chose to go for the [STM32 BluePill version](https://onstep.groups.io/g/main/wiki/6408) 
which looked like a good compromise between price and performance. 
My config file for version OnStep 3.16 is given as example.
